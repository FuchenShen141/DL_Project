# DL_Project
Deep Learning Project of Deep-Red flash with low-light image enhancement

To test model, run Ensemble.ipynb under image_filtering to ensemble results from different network. Please change the data path to your own colab path.

To evaluate model and compute loss, please run evaluate.ipynb under image_filtering. Also, change the data path to different network output you want to compute.

To get the result from different network, please run different network ipynb file to generate result.

The generated outputs of different network are under image_filtering->other_test.

The ensemble outputs are under image_filtering->ensemble_results

The loss results are in DL_Results.xlsx
